# Controls #

## Purpose ##
Control's purpose is to take a trajectory for the robot, its position, and calculate the motor speeds needed to follow
the trajectory. Besides calculating the speeds for the drive motors, controls also determines whether to run the intake
or outtake based on the plan generated by planning.

## How It Works ##
Control first turns to face its goal with a PID loop, then drives towards its goal at a constant speed. Eventually, both
these steps will use PID loops.

## Future Work ##
- [ ] Controls uses a PID loop to turn towards its next goal, but not to drive towards it yet
- [ ] Turn while driving straight
